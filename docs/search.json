Fever was due to excess of yellow bile (many infections caused jaundice)\nGalen: many types of fever developed from putrification of humors.\nMiddle ages: demonic possession\n18th century (Harvy’s discovery of circulation)- friction of blood flow through body causing fermentation and putrification in intestines\nClaude Bernard in the 19th century- metabolic processes in the body"
