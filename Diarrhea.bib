  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular diagnostic panels for enteric pathogens offer increased sensitivity and reduced turnaround time. However, many pathogen detections do not change clinical management, and the cost is substantial. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of adult outpatients with diarrhea at the University of Virginia who had samples tested by the FilmArray Gastrointestinal Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT) to identify the clinical yield and to validate the clinical criteria for testing recommended in the 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. RESULTS: We analyzed 629 tests sent from adult outpatients with diarrhea between March 23, 2015, and July 18, 2016. A pathogen was detected in 127 of 629 specimens (20.2\%). The most common pathogens were enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (47, 7.5\%), norovirus (24, 3.8\%), enteroaggregative E. coli (14, 2.2\%), Campylobacter (9, 1.4\%), and Salmonella (9; 1.4\%). The clinical yield of testing was low, with antimicrobial treatment clearly indicated for only 18 subjects (2.9\%) and any change in clinical management indicated for 33 subjects (5.2\%). Following the clinical criteria for diagnostic testing from the 2017 IDSA guidelines, which suggest diagnostic testing for patients with fever, abdominal pain, blood in stool, or an immunocompromising condition, would have reduced testing by 32.3\% without significantly reducing the clinical yield (sensitivity, 97.0\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 84.2\%-99.9\%; negative predictive value, 99.5\%; 95\% CI, 97.3\%-100.0\%). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical yield of molecular diagnostic testing in this population was low. Compliance with IDSA guidelines in adult outpatients with diarrhea could reduce testing by approximately one-third.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The etiology of childhood diarrhea is frequently unknown. METHODS: We sought Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pleisiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia (by culture), adenoviruses, astroviruses, noroviruses, rotavirus, and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC; by enzyme immunoassay), Clostridium difficile (by cytotoxicity), parasites (by microscopy), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC; by polymerase chain reaction [PCR] analysis) in the stools of 254 children with diarrhea presenting to a pediatric emergency facility. Age- and geographic-matched community controls without diarrhea (n = 452) were similarly studied, except bacterial cultures of the stool were limited only to cases. RESULTS: Twenty-nine (11.4\%) case stools contained 13 Salmonella, 10 STEC (6 O157:H7 and 4 non-O157:H7 serotypes), 5 Campylobacter, and 2 Shigella. PCR-defined EAEC were present more often in case (3.2\%) specimens than in control (0.9\%) specimens (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-13.7), and their adherence phenotypes were variable. Rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus were more common among cases than controls, but both groups contained noroviruses and C. difficile at similar rates. PCR evidence of hypervirulent C. difficile was found in case and control stools; parasites were much more common in control specimens. CONCLUSIONS: EAEC are associated with childhood diarrhea in Seattle, but the optimal way to identify these agents warrants determination. Children without diarrhea harbor diarrheagenic pathogens, including hypervirulent C. difficile. Our data support the importance of taking into account host susceptibility, microbial density, and organism virulence traits in future case-control studies, not merely categorizing candidate pathogens as being present or absent.},

In the United States, children {$<$} 5 years of age experience {$>$} 20 million episodes of diarrhea each year, leading to several million doctor visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 400 deaths. Much of this morbidity is due to the dehydration associated with acute watery diarrhea. Consequently, the proper management of children with acute diarrhea is important for all practitioners as well as for parents of small children. The development of oral therapy for the rehydration and maintenance of children with dehydrating diarrhea has become the worldwide mainstay of national diarrheal control programs. More recently, proper nutrition for children with diarrhea is viewed as an important adjunct to therapy, whereas antibiotics and other drugs play only a limited role. Intravenous therapy remains essential for diarrheal episodes associated with severe dehydration. This document reviews the proper management of diarrhea among children. Particular attention is given to the use of oral therapy for rehydration and maintenance therapy for the dehydrated child and nutritional management. In the United States, the improved management of children with diarrhea could lead to a noticeable decrease in the number of children who are hospitalized or die as a result of diarrheal illness. This report contains recommendations prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with input from a panel of pediatric and diarrheal management experts, which are consistent with recommendations endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

METHODS: Between December 2014 and August 2018, children {$<$}18 years old with presumed acute gastroenteritis who presented to 2 emergency departments (EDs) in Alberta, Canada, were recruited. Eligible participants had {$\geq$}3 episodes of vomiting and/or diarrhea in a 24-hour period, {$<$}7 days of symptoms, and provided a rectal swab or stool specimen. We quantified the proportion of children with isolated vomiting in whom an enteropathogen was identified, and analyzed clinical characteristics, types of enteropathogens, resources used, and alternative diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 2695 participants, at the ED visit, 295 (10.9\%), 1321 (49.0\%), and 1079 (40.0\%) reported having isolated diarrhea, vomiting and diarrhea, or isolated vomiting, respectively. An enteropathogen was detected most commonly in those with vomiting and diarrhea (1067/1321; 80.8\%); detection did not differ between those with isolated diarrhea (170/295; 57.6\%) and isolated vomiting (589/1079; 54.6\%) (95\% confidence interval of the difference: -3.4\%, 9.3\%). Children with isolated vomiting most often had a virus (557/1077; 51.7\%), most commonly norovirus (321/1077; 29.8\%); 5.7\% (62/1079) had a bacterial pathogen. X-rays, ultrasounds, and urine tests were most commonly performed in children with isolated vomiting. Alternate etiologies were most common in those with isolated vomiting (5.7\%; 61/1079). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of enteropathogen identification in children with isolated vomiting using molecular diagnostic tests and rectal swabs is substantial. Molecular diagnostics offer an emerging diagnostic strategy in children with isolated vomiting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 provides an up-to-date analysis of the burden of diarrhoea in 195 countries. This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies in 1990-2016 and assesses how the burden of diarrhoea has changed in people of all ages. METHODS: We modelled diarrhoea mortality with a Bayesian hierarchical modelling platform that evaluates a wide range of covariates and model types on the basis of vital registration and verbal autopsy data. We modelled diarrhoea incidence with a compartmental meta-regression tool that enforces an association between incidence and prevalence, and relies on scientific literature, population representative surveys, and health-care data. Diarrhoea deaths and episodes were attributed to 13 pathogens by use of a counterfactual population attributable fraction approach. Diarrhoea risk factors are also based on counterfactual estimates of risk exposure and the association between the risk and diarrhoea. Each modelled estimate accounted for uncertainty. FINDINGS: In 2016, diarrhoea was the eighth leading cause of death among all ages (1\hphantom{,}655\hphantom{,}944 deaths, 95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 1\hphantom{,}244\hphantom{,}073-2\hphantom{,}366\hphantom{,}552) and the fifth leading cause of death among children younger than 5 years (446\hphantom{,}000 deaths, 390\hphantom{,}894-504\hphantom{,}613). Rotavirus was the leading aetiology for diarrhoea mortality among children younger than 5 years (128\hphantom{,}515 deaths, 105\hphantom{,}138-155\hphantom{,}133) and among all ages (228\hphantom{,}047 deaths, 183\hphantom{,}526-292\hphantom{,}737). Childhood wasting (low weight-for-height score), unsafe water, and unsafe sanitation were the leading risk factors for diarrhoea, responsible for 80{$\cdot$}4\% (95\% UI 68{$\cdot$}2-85{$\cdot$}0), 72{$\cdot$}1\% (34{$\cdot$}0-91{$\cdot$}4), and 56{$\cdot$}4\% (49{$\cdot$}3-62{$\cdot$}7) of diarrhoea deaths in children younger than 5 years, respectively. Prevention of wasting in 1762 children (95\% UI 1521-2170) could avert one death from diarrhoea. INTERPRETATION: Substantial progress has been made globally in reducing the burden of diarrhoeal diseases, driven by decreases in several primary risk factors. However, this reduction has not been equal across locations, and burden among adults older than 70 years requires attention. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

CDI should be suspected in case of unexplained diarrhea and abdominal pain in patients with a recent history of antibiotic use and healthcare exposures; diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings with demonstration of C. difficile toxins by stool test. The advantages of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) are the noninvasiveness and the ability to evaluate both the colonic wall and the adjacent soft tissues. Considerable overlap exists between the CECT findings of CDI and those of colitis of other origins, such as typhlitis, ischemic colitis, graft-versus-host disease, radiation colitis and inflammatory bowel diseases; however, some features may help distinguish between these conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the imaging features of Clostridium difficile colitis and its mimics, with a view to assist the radiologist in reaching the correct diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Diarrheal illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, yet the etiologic agent of many cases of gastrointestinal illness remains unspecified, often due to the lack of convenient, timely, and sensitive diagnostic testing. Although bulk fecal specimens remain the recommended specimen type for enteric culture, rectal swabs may be an option preferred by clinicians and patients due to the convenience and timing of collection. However, the lack of data evaluating the sensitivity of rectal swabs compared to fecal specimens for detection of enteric pathogens precludes this specimen type from being recommended by national guidelines. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 480 paired rectal swab and fecal specimens submitted for enteric culture to the Barnes-Jewish Hospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital microbiology laboratories in St. Louis, MO, from 2002 to 2017. We report 32\% positivity of paired specimens with an overall agreement of 93\% and Cohen's {$\kappa$} of 0.84 (95\% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.89). Additionally, we evaluated the time to result from the time of patient presentation to the health care setting and demonstrate that rectal swabs have a significantly shorter time to an actionable result than bulk fecal specimens (median, 67.4\,h versus 78.4\,h, respectively; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). These findings indicate that rectal swabs facilitate on-demand culture-based testing with a sensitivity comparable to that of fecal specimens and thus should be recommended for enteric bacterial culture when bulk fecal specimens are unavailable.},

The Luminex xTAG GI panel includes 14 microbial targets and the Biofire FilmArray GI panel includes 22. The purpose of this scoping review was to describe clinical use of these two commercially available syndromic GI panels. Compared with conventional testing, syndromic panels increase the number of potential pathogens identified by two- to fivefold. Syndromic panels were associated with non-reproducible results, positive results in the absence of clinical disease, and positive results for pathogens of unclear clinical significance. Syndromic panels were less likely to provide new information when performed {$>$} 72 h after hospital admission or when repeated within 4 weeks of a previous test. Process measures or clinical outcomes related to testing were infrequently reported. Outcomes-based research is needed to determine the clinical impact of syndromic GI panels. Strategies for diagnostic stewardship that may increase the utility of GI panels include (1) development of clinical criteria for testing, (2) use of multi-step testing algorithms that start with tests for the most common organisms (Clostridium difficile and norovirus), (3) selective reporting of results, (4) reporting results through a mediator such as the infection preventionist or antibiotic stewardship pharmacist, and (5) maintenance of separate pathways for C. difficile testing.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY  The recent development of commercial panel-based molecular diagnostics for the rapid detection of pathogens in positive blood culture bottles, respiratory specimens, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid has resulted in a paradigm shift in clinical microbiology and clinical practice. This review focuses on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved/cleared multiplex molecular panels with more than five targets designed to assist in the diagnosis of bloodstream, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system infections. While these panel-based assays have the clear advantages of a rapid turnaround time and the detection of a large number of microorganisms and promise to improve health care, they present certain challenges, including cost and the definition of ideal test utilization strategies (i.e., optimal ordering) and test interpretation.},

Most (58\%) illnesses were caused by norovirus, followed by nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. (11\%), Clostridium perfringens (10\%), and Campylobacter spp. (9\%). Leading causes of hospitalization were nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. (35\%), norovirus (26\%), Campylobacter spp. (15\%), and Toxoplasma gondii (8\%). Leading causes of death were nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. (28\%), T. gondii (24\%), Listeria monocytogenes (19\%), and norovirus (11\%). These estimates cannot be compared with prior (1999) estimates to assess trends because different methods were used. Additional data and more refined methods can improve future estimates.},

During a 3-year period, only 1 of 191 positive stool cultures and none of the 90 ova and parasite examinations with positive results were from the group of patients who had stool specimens submitted after 3 days of hospitalization. Analysis of laboratory work load for a 1-year period showed that specimens from this patient group contributed nearly 50\% of the more than 3000 specimens received each year. In contrast, approximately 25\% (range, 17\% to 33\%) of samples, regardless of admission status, were positive for C difficile toxin. Eliminating routine stool cultures and ova and parasite examinations on hospitalized patients would significantly reduce hospital and patient costs without altering patient care. Nationwide, such a policy might achieve a cost savings of +20 to +30 million per year.},

  abstract = {We aimed to detect the etiological agents of acute diarrhea by a molecular gastrointestinal pathogen test (MGPT) and to assess the impact of MGPT on antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP). This is a prospective observational study and was conducted between 1 January 2015 and 30 June 2017. We included consequent patients who had acute diarrhea. At the end of 2015, we implemented ASP in acute diarrhea cases and compared the outcomes in the pre-ASP and post-ASP periods. An FDA-cleared multiplexed gastrointestinal PCR panel system, the BioFire FilmArray (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT), which detects 20 pathogens in stool, was used. In 499 out of 699 patients (71\%), at least one pathogen was detected. Among 314 adults with positive MGPT, 101 (32\%) enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), 71 (23\%) enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), 68 (22\%) enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), 55 (18\%) Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) (17\%) Norovirus, 48 (15\%) Campylobacter, 21 (7\%) Salmonella, and 20 (6\%) Clostridium difficile strains were detected. Among 185 children, 55 (30\%) EPEC, 37 (20\%) C. difficile, 32 (17\%) Norovirus, 29 (16\%) EAEC, 22 (12\%) STEC, 21 (11\%) ETEC, 21 (11\%) Campylobacter, 20 (11\%) Salmonella, and 16 (5\%) Rotavirus strains were detected. Inappropriate antibiotic use decreased in the post-ASP period compared with the pre-ASP period among inpatients (42.9\% and 25.8\%, respectively; P = 0.023). Using MGPT in clinical practice significantly decreased the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Detection of high rates of C. difficile in children and Salmonella spp., as well as relatively high rates of Campylobacter spp., which were hard to isolate by routine stool culture, were remarkable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the epidemiologic characteristics of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children. The authors' aim was to evaluate the incidence of AAD in an outpatient pediatric population and to identify risk factors. METHODS: Children aged 1 month to 15.4 years treated with oral antibiotics for a proven or suspected infection were enrolled from an ambulatory pediatric practice during an 11-month period. Parents recorded the daily frequency and characteristics of stools using a diary during the antibiotic treatment and for 1 week after it was stopped. An episode of diarrhea was defined by at least 3 soft or liquid stools/d for at least 2 consecutive days. Risk factors for AAD-age, type of antibiotic treatment, type of combined treatment, and site of infection-were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 650 children included, 11\% had an episode of AAD, lasting a mean of 4.0 +/- 3.0 days, beginning a mean of 5.3 +/- 3.5 days after the start of antibiotic treatment. No child was hospitalized because of AAD. The incidence of AAD was higher in children less than 2 years (18\%) than in those more than 2 years (3\%; P {$<$} 0.0001). The incidence of AAD was particularly high after administration of certain antibiotics (amoxicillin/clavulanate, 23\%; P = 0.003 compared with other antibiotics). The type of combined treatment and site of infection did not influence the onset of AAD. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea was common in these outpatient children, especially for those aged less than 2 years and after the prescription of certain antibiotics, particularly, the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanate.},

A total of 173 patients were recruited for the study and received either ciprofloxacin (500 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for 5 days, during which time they recorded the duration of diarrhea and other symptoms (fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, and myalgia). Fecal samples were collected before treatment and regularly after treatment to determine the duration of carriage of gastrointestinal pathogens. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin were determined. A significant reduction in the duration of diarrhea and other symptoms was observed after treatment, regardless of whether a pathogen was detected (P = .0001). Treatment failure occurred in 3 of 81 patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 17 of 81 patients in the placebo group. Significant pathogens were detected in 87\% of patients, 85.5\% of whom had cleared the pathogen at the end of treatment with ciprofloxacin, as compared with 34\% who received placebo. Six weeks after treatment, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the pathogen carriage rate (12\%). Treatment with ciprofloxacin did not prolong carriage. High-level resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC, {$>$} 32 mg/L) was detected in three strains (4\%) of Campylobacter species.},
