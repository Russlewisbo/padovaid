## The impact of malaria on humans is <br> is staggering

<br>

-   Kills roughly 2000 people per day, most of whom are children in Africa

-   The strongest documented force for evolutionary selection in the recent history of the human genome

    -   Malaria is the evolutionary driving force behind the most common Mendelian diseases of humankind: sickle-cell disease, thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency, and other erythrocyte defects

-   Malaria was once prevalent throughout much of the inhabited world, but has been eliminated from the USA and Canada, Europe, and Russia (chloroquine-based treatment, large-scale insecticide using DDT)

    -   Malaria prevalence resurged in tropical countries from the 1970s to the 1990s because of a combination of relaxation of control efforts, increasing antimalarial drug resistance, and insecticide resistance in the mosquito vectors
    -   More selective vector control approaches (insecticide bed nets, indoor residual spraying) have led to a reduction in some areas of the world in the last 20 years

-   Growing resistance to insecticides in mosquitoes (*Anopheles gambiae)*

    -   Of the 78 countries that monitor insecticide resistance, 60 have reported resistance
    -   Increasing resistance to first-line XXXXX

## Autochthonous transmission

<br>

-   Airport malaria
-   Asymptomatic donors from endemic aras with low-level parasitemia
    -   Blood donors
    -   Solid organ transplant

## Cases in Italy

!["It's the first time in my 30-year career that I've seen a case of malaria originating in Trentino," said Dr Claudio Paternoster, an infectious diseases specialist at Trento's Santa Chiara Hospital. Since the 1950s, Italy has not had a malaria problem because mosquito-infested marshes were drained. There is speculation that Sofia might have caught malaria from one of two children treated for it at the Trento hospital after 15 August. They had caught it in Africa, and recovered.](images_malaria/Malaria_Italy.png){fig-align="center"}

[@phillips2017]
:::

## Clinical presentation

<br>

-   First symptoms are typically experienced 2-4 weeks after mosquito bite
-   Asexual replication in RBCs results in subsequent waves of merozoite and malaria endotoxin release (heamozoin and parasite DNA) → TNF-α and paroxysms of chills, fevers and sweats for several hours followed by extreme fatigue
-   Cycle repeats every:
    -   24 hours *Plasmodium knowlesi*
    -   48 hours *Plasmodium falciparam, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale*
    -   72 hours *Plasmodium malaria*
-   Some *P. vivax* and *P. ovale* can postpone development in liver as latent forms called hypnozoites (not eradicated by standard therapy e.g., chloroquine) directed against blood stages.
-   Hyponozoite development can resume months to years later leading to relapse
    -   Relapse can be prevented with primaquine, but only moderately effective

## Five species of *Plasmodium* infection in humans

+-------------------+-------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *Plasmodium spp*. | Liver stage | Blood cycle and fever peaks | Disease features                                                                               |
+===================+=============+=============================+================================================================================================+
| *P. falciprium*   | 6-14 days   | 48h (tertian)               | Major complications, fatal without treatment                                                   |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *P. vivax*        | 12-17 days  | 48h (tertian)               | Seldom fatal, but can better survive unfavourable temperatures and remain dormant in the liver |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## *Plasmodium falciparum*

::: nonincremental
-   Most deadly (1 million deaths per year- anaemia and cerebral malaria)

-   *Sequestration*- parasitized RBCs: glomerulonephritis, hypoglycaemia, pulmonary edema

-   Almost all deaths are caused by this species

## Cerebral malaria

<br>

-   Cerebral malaria (intense sequestration of infected erythrocytes in cerebral microvessels)
-   Ring haemorrhages, perivascular leukocyte infiltrates, thrombin deposition
-   Retinal abnormalities are common in children with characteristic features include whitening of the macula (that spares the central fovea), peripheral retina, retinal vessels, papilledema, and multiple retinal haemorrhages
-   Ring hemorrhages, perivascular leukocyte infiltrates, thrombin deposition
-   Retinal abnormalities are common in children with characteristic features include whitening of the macula (that spares the central fovea), peripheral retina, retinal vessels, papilloedema, and multiple retinal haemorrhages
-   Impairement of local delivery of oxygen and glucose
-   Often does not produce neurological sequelae akin to thrombotic stroke
    -   Recovery within 48 hours common

## Malaria- acquired immunity

<br>

-   Mediated by IgG antibodies against surface proteins of sporozoite (blocking hepatocyte invasion)

    -   Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, opsonisation for uptake, destruction by splenic macrophages, interference with PfEMP-1 mediated cytoadhearence interactions

-   Immunity not sterilizing, instead "disease-controlling immunity" despite presence of parasites in bloodstream

-   Immunity increases with age, cumulative episodes and time living in endemic area

    -   Short-lived without continued exposure to different *P. falciparum* variants

    -   Antigen switching results in new waves of parasitemia, escape from antibody responses

    -   Disease controlling immunity (premunition) after repeated infection episodes associated with development of antibody repertoire that recognizes the full spectrum PfEMP-1 variant antigens

        ![](images_malaria/recurrent.jpeg){width="600"}

## Host traits that influence disease severity <br>(besides blood disorders)

<br>

-   **Splenectomy** - high parasite loads

    -   Splenomegaly common in malaria (removal of infected erythrocytes) but contributes to anaemia associated with disease

-   **Pregnancy** - parasites that express protein surface variant antigen 2-CSA (chondroitin sulphate-2, a glycoproteins expressed in the placenta) leading to infected red blood cell sequestration in the placenta

    -   Increased risk of maternal and/or foetal death, miscarriage, inter-uterine growth retardation, low-birth weight, increased newborn mortality

-   **HIV** (higher degree of parasitemia, mortality)

-   **Tuberculosis**

## Complications of malaria

<br>

-   **Hypoglycaemia (coma, convulsions)**

    -   Children: Impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased glucose consumption in peripheral tissues and by parasites, **normal insulin levels**

    -   Adults: Hyperinsulinemia due to parasite stimulation of pancreatic islet cells or quinine/quinidine therapy

    -   Decreased food intake during prodromal period

-   **Anaemia**

    -   Intra vascular lysis and phagocytic removal of infected erythrocytes
    -   TNF-α associated suppression of erythropoetin
    -   Normochromic, normocytic anaemia without robust reticulocyte response

-   **Pulmonary oedema and respiratory distress**

    -   Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema due to sequestration of infected erythrocytes → inflammatory response → capillary permeability → pulmonary oedema → hypoxia →acute lung injury → ARDS
    -   Dyspnea and increasing respiratory rate are features of impending pulmonary oedema and preclude other clinical (e.g., accessory muscle breathing) and radiologic signs (increased interstitial markings)
    -   TNF-α associated suppression of erythropoeitin
    -   Normochromic, normocytic anemia without robust reticolocyte response

-   **Pulmonary oedema and respiratory distress**

    -   Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema due to sequesterization of infected erythromyctes → inflammatory response → capillary permability → pulmonary oedema → hypoxia →acute lung injury → ARDS
    -   Dyspne and increasing respiratory rate are features of impending pulmonary oedema and preclude other clinical (e.g., acessory muscle breathing) and radiologic signs (increased interestitial markings)

-   **Metabolic (lactic) acidosis**

    -   Reduced delivery of oxygen to tissues from combined effects of anaemia, sequesterization and hypovolemia
    -   Shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism causes lactate levels to rise
    -   Lactate clearance by liver reduced

-   **Acute renal failure**

## Diagnosis and Screening {background-image="/images_malaria/rings.png" background-opacity="0.5"}

## Clinical History

-   **Febrile illness** (cyclic paroxysms of chills rigors and fever with drenching night sweats after travel to an endemic area)

    -   Fever 100%

    -   Headache 100%

    -   Weakness 94%

    -   Pofuse night sweats 91%

    -   Insomina 61%

    -   Arthrlagias 59%

    -   myalgias 56%

    -   Diarrhea 13%

    -   Abdominal cramps 8%

-   **Physical exam**

    -   Pallor
    -   Hepatosplenomegaly
    -   Jaundice, diminished consciousness, convulsions (severe malaria)
    -   Less common (rash, lymphadenopathy, pulmonary consolidations)

:::

## Parasitemia

-   Light microscopy of Giemsa-stained blood smears is the accepted standard for diagnosis

-   Thick smears concentrate red cell layers 40-fold and used to screen large amounts of blood for parasites- RBCs lyse so parasites are visualized *outside* red cells

    -   Parasite density can be calculated by counting the number of parasites per 200 WBCs x 40 = number of parasites per μL blood

    -   For P. falciparum, initial blood smears may be negative because mature erythrocytes (trophozoites and schizonts are sequestered in peripheral tissues)

    -   Smear is repeated every 12 hours until diagnosis is ruled in or ruled out

-   Thin smears used tp determine *Plasmodium* species

## Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)

-   **Detection of *Plasmodium* histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2)**

    -   Limited to *P. falciparum*

    -   Not useful for monitoring treatment response (positive for 28 days)

    -   Less sensitive at parasite densities of 100-1000/μL (may miss non-immune travellers with symptoms at low parasite densities)

-   **Detection of *P. falciparum* specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pan-*Plasmodium* LDH**

    -   Adequate sensitivity for *P. vivax, P. ovale,* and *P. malaria* with less sensitivity for *P. falciparum*

    -   However, positive signal is proportional to *P. falciparum* parasitaemia, allowing for monitoring of therapeutic response

-   **Combination tests of HRP-2/LDH under development**

## Other laboratory tests

-   Decreases in haemoglobin, hematocrit and haptoglobin and increases in LDH expected

-   Leukocyte and platelet counts are

## WHO diagnostic features of severe malaria <br> (emergency requiring ICU care)

-   Any of the following criteria + *P. falciparum* parasitaemia

    -   Cerebral malaria (decreases consciousness, seizures)

    -   Respiratory distress

    -   Prostration

    -   Hyperparasitaemia

    -   Severe anaemia

    -   Hypoglycemia

    -   Jaundice/icterus

    -   Renal insufficiency

    -   Hemoglobinuria
