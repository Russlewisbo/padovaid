## Objectives

## How is fever of unknown origin (FUO) defined?

<br> <br> Subjective definition, but core features include: <br>

-   Not a biologically-uniform phenomenon
-   Absence of an identified cause of fever despite reasonable diagnostic investigations
-   Persistence of fever for a sufficient time to rule out "self-limiting fevers"
-   "Diagnosis of exclusion"
-   Thoughtful, critical appraisal of patient *vs.* algorithm approach

## What is the history of fever? {background-image="/images/hippocrates.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

-   Described in Akkadian cuneiform inscriptions from the 6th century BC
-   Hippocratic physicians proposed that body temperature, and physiologic harmony in general, involved a delicate balance among four corporal humors---blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Fever was due to excess of yellow bile (many infections caused jaundice)
-   Galen: many types of fever developed from putrification of humors.
-   Middle ages: demonic possession
-   18th century (Harvy's discovery of circulation)- friction of blood flow through body causing fermentation and putrification in intestines
-   Claude Bernard in the 19th century- metabolic processes in the body

## The febrile response {background-image="/images/thermometer.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

-   Wunderlich's pioneering studies of thermometry-normal 37°C

-   Since the 19th century, humans have become gradually colder-0.05 to 0.5°C per decade

-   Current normal range is 36.3 to 36.5°C
