## Fever of unknown origin (FUO) {background-image="/images/bacteria.png"}

## Objectives

## What is the history of fever? {background-image="/images/hippocrates.jpg" background-opacity="0.2" data-background-size="contain"}

<br>

-   10th Century BCE Persian Physician Akhawayni defined a system for fever curves in Hidāyat al-Muta'allimīn fī al-Tibb (The Student's Handbook of Medicine)
-   Hippocratic physicians proposed that body temperature, and physiologic harmony in general, involved a delicate balance among four corporal humors---blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Fever was due to excess of yellow bile (many infections caused jaundice)
-   Galen: many types of fever developed from putrification of humors.
-   Middle ages: demonic possession
-   18th century (Harvy's discovery of circulation)- friction of blood flow through body causing fermentation and putrification in intestines
-   Claude Bernard in the 19th century- metabolic processes in the body

## Febris- Roman Goddess of Fever

<br>

<br>

The legend of Febris was said to center around the haunting marshes of Camagna in Southern Italy where like clockwork every year, the people would become deathly ill with a mysterious disease. She was so feared by the Romans that the suffering population had created a cult to Febris. They went so far as to wear protective amulets and build her temples in order to worship her to win her favour.

## The fever response {background-image="/images/thermometer.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

<br>

-   Wunderlich's pioneering studies of thermometry-normal 37°C

-   Since the 19th century, humans have become gradually colder-0.05 to 0.5°C per decade

-   Current normal range is 36.3 to 36.5°C

## Sequelae of fever

<br>

-   Phylogenetic conservation of fever over the millennia suggests fever is beneficial
-   Most pathogenic bacteria are mesophiles (35°C ideal for growth)
-   Fever generates hepatic iron-sequestering compounds the bind free iron necessary for microbial replication

## Classic FUO

<br>

-   **Definition:**
    -   \> 38.3°C \> 3 weeks;

    -   \>2 seperate outpatient visits with diagnostic investigations

    -   \>2 visits in hospital of 3 days with diagnostic investigations
-   **Leading causes:**
    -   Cancer

    -   Infections

    -   Inflammatory conditions

    -   Undiagnosed habitual hyperthermia

## Frequency of the 5 main etiologic categories of FUO

Infectious causes decrease in patients above age 65 years

## Classic FUO- Infectious Etiology

-   Abscess
-   Endocarditis
-   Tuberculosis
-   Complicated urinary tract infections

## Classic FUO work-up

-   **Medical history emphasis:**
    -   Travel

    -   Contacts

    -   Animal and insect exposure

    -   Medications

    -   Immunizations

    -   Family history

    -   Cardiac valve disorder
-   **Examination emphasis**
    -   Fundi, oropharynx, temporal artery, abdomen, lymph nodes, spleen, joints, skin, nails, genitalia, rectum or prostate, lower limb deep veins
-   **Investigation emphasis:**
    -   Imaging, biopsies, sedimentation rate, skin tests

## Rare and miscellaneous causes of fever

## Distinctive fever patterns {.smaller}

![](images/feverpatterns.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

A. Maleria; B. Typhoid fever with relative bradycardia; C. Hodgkin's disease (Pel-Ebstein pattern); <br> D. Borreliosis (relapsing fever pattern)

## Classic FUO in infants and children

-   Respiratory tract infections
-   Other infections: UTIs, brucellosis, tuberculosis, bartonellosis
-   Kawasaki disease (age \< 5 years)
-   Inflammatory bowel diseases
-   Still's disease (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis)
    -   However, connective tissue diseases and cancers are generally rarer in children vs. adults
-   Joint involvement is a sign of a serious disorder- e.g., connective tissue disease, endocarditis, leukemia

## Classic FUO in elderly patients

-   **In developed countries: connective tissue diseases \> infections**
    -   Temporal arteritis

    -   Polymyalgia rheumatic syndromes

    -   Diagnoses are frequently missed because symptoms are subacute and non-specific
-   **Infections**
    -   intraabdominal abscess

    -   Complicated UTIs

    -   Tuberculosis

    -   Endocarditis

## Returning travellers

## Naproxin (NSIAD) suppression test

## How is fever of unknown origin (FUO) defined?

<br> <br> Subjective definition, but core features include: <br>

-   Not a biologically-uniform phenomenon
-   Absence of an identified cause of fever despite reasonable diagnostic investigations
-   Persistence of fever for a sufficient time to rule out "self-limiting fevers"
-   "Diagnosis of exclusion"
-   Thoughtful, critical appraisal of patient *vs.* algorithm approach
