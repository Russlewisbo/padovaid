## Infectious Diarrheal Diseases {background-image="/images3/diarrhea.png"}

<br>

<br>

Russell Lewis <br> Associate Professor, Infectious Diseases <br> Department of Molecular Medicine <br> <br>MEP 2491 Infectious Diseases <br> 27 March 2023 <br> <br> ![](800-unipd.svg){fig-align="left" width="300"}

## Objectives

<br>

-   Identify the most common causes of infectious diarrhea in adult patients in resource-rich settings
-   Describe how the patient history and clinical presentation of diarrhea may favour viral versus bacterial causes that benefit from antibiotic therapy
-   Recognize warning signs for severe diarrheal disease that require immediate hospitalization and/or antibiotic therapy
-   Describe management approach and treatment of common infectious diarrheal pathogens

We will not be discussing (in detail) diarrheal diseases in resource-poor countries. Information on these infections should be obtained from the [WHO guidelines](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diarrhoeal-disease#:~:text=Diarrhoea%20should%20be%20treated%20with,diarrhoea%20duration%20and%20improves%20outcomes.)

## Background {.smaller background-image="/images3/diarrhea2.png" background-opacity="0.5"}

<br>

-   Diarrheal disease is one of the top ten leading causes of death worldwide
-   Diarrheal disease is a particular concern for children younger than five years old in resource-limited settings
-   Among adults in resource-rich settings, diarrhea is often a "nuisance disease" in the healthy individual
-   Most cases of acute diarrhea in adults are of infectious etiology, and most cases resolve with symptomatic treatment alone
-   When clinicians care for adults with diarrhea, two important decision points are:
    -   When to perform stool testing
    -   Whether to initiate empiric antimicrobial therapy

## Definitions {.smaller background-image="/images3/diarrhea3.png" background-opacity="0.2"}

<br>

<br>

-   Diarrhea is defined as the passage of loose or watery stools, typically at least three times in a 24-hour period
-   Reflects increased water content of the stool, whether due to impaired water absorption and/or active water secretion by the bowel
    -   Acute -- 14 days or fewer in duration
    -   Persistent diarrhea -- more than 14 but fewer than 30 days in duration
    -   Chronic -- more than 30 days in duration
-   Invasive diarrhea, *dysentery*- diarrhea with visible blood or mucous
    -   Dysentery is commonly associated with fever and abdominal pain

## Etiology {.smaller background-image="/images3/ecoli.png" background-opacity="0.2"}

<br> <br>

-   Most cases of acute diarrhea are due to infections and are self-limited
-   Most cases of acute infectious diarrhea are viral, as indicated by the observation that stool cultures are positive in only 1.5 to 5.6 % of cases
-   The major causes of acute infectious diarrhea include:
    -   **Viruses** (norovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, astrovirus, and others)
    -   **Bacteria** (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Clostridioides difficile, and others)
    -   **Protozoa** (Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Cyclospora, Entamoeba, and others)

## Norovirus "winter vomiting virus"

![](images3/norovirus.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

<div>

[@Ahmed2014]

</div>

## Norovirus {background-image="/images3/norovirus.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   **Epidemiology**
    -   Nonenveloped RNA virus from Caliciviradae family
    -   Commonest cause of gastroenteritis worldwide
    -   Although antibody prevalence rises through childhood.
    -   Re-infection is common as their is no lasting immunity due to re-infection with diversity of strains
-   **Transmission**
    -   Spread by fecal-oral route from person to person, aerosol in vomitus, contaminated food and water, fomite on surfaces (resists killing by alcohol or chlorine, temperatures up to 60°C)
    -   Outbreaks are common

## Norovirus {background-image="/images3/norovirus.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   **Clinical manifestations**:
    -   Vomiting
    -   Watery diarrhea, non-bloody and non-bilious, 4-8 stools/ 24 hours period
    -   Fever in 50% of cases
    -   Malaise, headache
    -   Abdominal pain
    -   Patients at risk of dehydration
    -   White blood cell count elevated or normal, lymphopenia common
    -   Short duration of illness (48-72 hours) with complete recovery
-   **Diagnosis**:
    -   Diagnosed clinically although antigen detection (enzyme immunoassay) or PCR may be used in outbreak settings.
-   **Treatment**:
    -   Supportive care (hydration)

## Rotavirus

-   Mean duration of symptoms for 3-8 days
-   Occurs in children 6 months-2 years
-   Occasionally causes diarrhea in elderly
-   Vomiting less of a prominent feature vs. norovirus

![image: Centers for Disease Control](images3/rotovirus.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

## Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) {background-image="/images3/ETEC.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   Cause of dehydrating diarrhea , especially in developing world (\< 2 years) due to ability to survive in water and production of heat-stabile and heat-labile toxins
-   Causes watery diarrhea in returning travellers **with nausea but no vomiting** and symptoms lasting as long as 5 days

## Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) {background-image="/images3/EPEC.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   Diarrhea common in children \< 6 months in developing world
-   Sporadic outbreaks in adults
-   Severe diarrhea that can result in dehydration and malnutrition

## Entero-hemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) <br> or Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) {background-image="/images3/STEC.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

-   Incubation of 1-4 days

-   Main serotypes E. coli O157:H7 or E. coli O101:h4 (STEC)

-   Often cause bloody diarrhea, abdominal tenderness **with lack of fever**

-   Occasional cause of pseudomembraneous colitis (when negative for C. difficile)

-   Increased White blood cell count

-   Associated with outbreaks (contaminated food)

-   Can cause hemolytic uremia syndrome (5-10 days after diarrhea) 6-9% of EHEC infections affecting mostly children \< 10 years:

    -   Renal failure

    -   Thrombocytopenia

    -   Thrombotic microangiopathic anemia (↓ PLT count, haptoglobin, RBC, ↑LDH, SeCr)

-   Neurologic symptoms-motor deficits and seizure)

## Schistocytes seen in peripheral blood with <br>HUS

![](images3/schistocytes.png){fig-align="center"}

## HUS long-term sequelae {background-image="/images3/STEC.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   Renal failure and hypertension (39%)
-   Neurologic symptoms

## Italy: E. coli 0157:H7

<br>

![](images3/Italy_HUS.png){fig-align="center"}

## How can E. coli O157 infection be detected?

<br>

-   Culture on sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) agar with first 6 days of bloody diarrhea
    -   E. coli O157 cannot ferment lactose, but can ferment sorbitol
-   Toxin detection (Shiga toxin, EIA in stool)

![](images3/sorbitol.png){fig-align="center"}

## Why is it important to identify E. coli 0157 (EHEC)?

<br>

-   Tracing an outbreak (i.e. contaminated produce)
-   **Antibiotic therapy increases the risk of HUS in EHEC by 25% and should be avoided, especially in young children**
-   Treatment with supportive measures and avoidance of anti-motility agents (e.g., loperamide) to reduce the risk of complications

## Other E. coli- Enteroinvasive (EIEC) and Enteroaggregative (EaggEC)

-   EIEC relatively rare, closely related to *Shigella*
    -   Often watery diarrhea- rarely progresses to bloody diarrhea
-   EaggEC
    -   Affects the immunocompromised
    -   Cause of persistent diarrhea in patients with HIV
    -   Affects young children more frequently
    -   Can often be eradicated with antibiotics

## Campylobacter {background-image="/images3/campy.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

-   Gram-negative that belongs to the Enterobacteriales (previously known as a *Vibrio-*type organism associated with abortion in cattle and sheep)
-   Seen worldwide and a leading cause of gastroenteritis, including in the Arctic and temperate areas
-   *Campylobacter jejuni* most common species

## Campylobacter transmission {background-image="/images3/pettingzoo.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   Cross-contamination of food: Common commensal in GI tract of wild and domestic animals, **poultry** and birds
    -   Food handlers: good hand hygiene; meat should be cooked to high temperatures (82°C, 180°F).
    -   Don't drink unpasteurized milk
    -   Infection can occur from eating undercooked meat
-   Survives in freshwater (including at temps below (15°C) → infection from swimming or drinking contaminated water
-   Direct transmission from infected animals, pets, carcasses- handwashing should be encouraged especially for vulnerable adults or children visiting farms or petting zoos
-   Person-to-person transmission (nursery staff working with infected children)
-   Sexual transmission (anal intercourse)
-   Increased infection risk in patients with increased gastric acidity (achlorhydria or protein pump inhibitor use)

## Clinical factures of campylobacter infection {background-image="/images3/abdominalpain2.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   Mean incubation 3 days (range 1-7)
-   *Campylobacter* can affect either large or small bowel, hence causes both watery and bloody diarrhea
-   Classic prodrome: Fevers, rigours, dizziness in 1/3 of patients prior to GI symptoms → increased severity of disease
-   Abdominal pain:
    -   Abrupt, sever, cramping, colicky, periumbilical- not always accompanied by diarrhea
    -   

## Salmonella

## Enteric fever or typhoid (*Salmonella enterica* serotype typhi*)*

## Clostridiodes (Clostridium) difficile

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile can also present with inflammatory diarrhea.

¶ Pathogens that are more classically associated with inflammatory diarrhea can also cause watery diarrhea, particularly early in the course of infection.

¶ EPEC, EAggEC, EHEC, ETEC may all contribute; routine laboratories and cultures will not differentiate these from E. coli which are normal flora

## Inflammatory signs: large-bowel infection {background-image="/images/thermometer.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

Fever, bloody or mucoid stools suggest invasive bacteria (eg, *Salmonella,* *Shigella*, or *Campylobacter*), enteric viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus \[CMV\] or adenovirus), *Entamoeba histolytica*, or *C. difficile*.

-   Bloody stools, think: Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli* (STEC) (eg, *E. coli* O157:H7) infection.
    -   Other bacterial causes of visibly bloody diarrhea are *Shigella*, *Campylobacter*, and *Salmonella* species.
    -   Bloody diarrhea can also reflect noninfectious etiologies such as inflammatory bowel disease or ischemic colitis.
    -   Syndromes that begin with diarrhea but progress to fever and systemic complaints, such as headache and muscle aches, should raise the possibility of :
        -   Typhoidal illness (particularly in travellers from resource-limited settings)
        -   *Listeria monocytogenes* (particularly if a stiff neck is also present in pregnant patient)

## Medical History: Exposures {background-image="/images3/medical history.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   Food history
-   Residence
-   Occupational exposure
-   Recent and remote travel
-   Pets
-   Hobbies

## Food history {background-image="/images3/potatosalad.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   Consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, raw or undercooked meat or fish, or organic vitamin preparations may suggest certain pathogens.
-   The timing of symptom onset following exposure to the suspected offending food can be an important clue to the diagnosis
    -   **Within six hours** -- suggests ingestion of a preformed toxin of *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Bacillus cereus*, particularly if nausea and vomiting were the initial symptoms
    -   **At 8 to 16 hours** -- suggests infection with *Clostridium perfringens*
    -   **More than 16 hours** -- suggests either viral or other bacterial infection (eg, contamination of food with enterotoxigenic or STEC or other pathogens)

## Other exposures {background-image="/images3/pettingzoo.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

-   Exposure to animals (poultry, turtles, petting zoos) has been associated with *Salmonella* infection.
-   Travel to a resource-limited setting increases the risk of bacterial diarrhea and also informs the risk of certain parasitic infections
-   Occupation in daycare centres has been associated with:
    -   infections with *Shigella*, *Cryptosporidium*, and *Giardia*.
    -   Rotavirus is a potential consideration, but decreased with vaccination

## Additional Medical history {background-image="/images3/medical history.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br></br>

-   Recent antibiotic use (as a clue to the presence of *C. difficile* infection)
-   Other medications (such as proton pump inhibitors, which can increase the risk of infectious diarrhea)
-   Predisposing conditions:
    -   Immunocompromised host or the possibility of nosocomial infection
    -   Medical history informing the likelihood of various pathogens
    -   Pregnancy increases the risk of listeriosis following consumption of contaminated meat products or unpasteurized dairy products approximately 20-fold
    -   Cirrhosis has been associated with *Vibrio* infection
    -   Hemochromatosis has been associated with Y*ersinia* infection

## Physical exam-1

<br>

-   **Exam focus- volume status and identifying complications**
    -   Volume depletion can be suggested by:
        -   dry mucous membranes
        -   diminished skin turgor\
        -   postural or frank reductions in blood pressure
        -   altered sensorium
-   These signs can be mild or absent with early hypovolemia

## Physical exam-2

-   Abdominal examination should focus on signs that suggest ileus or peritonitis

    -   Abdominal distension
    -   Pain with gentle percussion
    -   Abdominal rigidity, or rebound tenderness

-   ![](images3/abdominalpain.png){width="600" center}

## Laboratory exam {background-image="/images3/bloodsample.jpeg" background-opacity="0.4"}

-   Laboratory tests are not routinely warranted for most patients with acute diarrhea
-   If substantial volume depletion is present (suggested by signs or symptoms such as dark and concentrated urine), a basic metabolic panel should be performed to screen for hypokalemia or renal dysfunction
-   The complete blood count does not reliably distinguish bacterial etiologies of diarrhea from others but may be helpful in suggesting severe disease or potential complications
    -   A low platelet count may prompt concern for the development of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome
    -   Leukemoid reaction is consistent with the diagnosis of *C. difficile* infection.
-   Blood cultures should be obtained in patients with high fevers or who appear systemically ill

## When are stool cultures considered? {.smaller background-image="/images3/stool-test.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

<br>

::: nonincremental
-   **Severe illness**
    -   Profuse watery diarrhea with signs of hypovolemia
    -   Passage of \> 6 unformed stools per 24 hours
    -   Severe abdominal pain
    -   Need for hospitalization
-   **Other signs of symptoms concerning for inflammatory diarrhea**
    -   Bloody diarrhea
    -   Passage of many small stools containing blood and mucus
    -   Temperature \>38.5°
-   **High-risk host features**
    -   Age ≥ 70 years
    -   Comorbidities such as cardiac disease (exacerbated by hypovolemia or complicating fluid replacement)
    -   Immunocompromised condition (including advanced HIV)
    -   Inflammatory bowel disease
    -   Pregnancy
    -   Symptoms persisting more than 1 week
-   **Suspected public health issue**
:::

Goal: Identify a potential bacterial pathogen that would inform the potential for complications and treatment decisions

## Stool cultures {.smaller}

<br>

-   The optimal specimen for culture is a diarrheal stool specimen (conforms to container)o, which should be inoculated onto culture plates as quickly as possible.

-   Routine stool culture will identify *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, and *Shigella*

-   *E. coli* O157:H7 can be isolated on sorbitol-MacConkey plates or identified with antigen testing or polymerase chain reaction of stool

-   A stool culture that is positive for one of these pathogens in a patient with acute diarrheal symptoms can be interpreted as a true positive.

-   If a stool specimen cannot be obtained promptly, a rectal swab culture can be obtained to accelerate the diagnosis although some data suggest decreased sensitivity in adults

-   May need to specify bacteria of interest

    -   Campylobacter
    -   Aeromonas, Yersina
    -   Vibrio-requires selective media

-   Bacterial pathogens are generally excreted continuously, in contrast to ova and parasites, which are often shed intermittently.

-   **Thus, a negative culture is usually not a false negative, and repeat specimens are rarely required.**

## Stool testing: molecular methods

-   Multipathogen molecular panels --- Some laboratories have access to multiplex stool tests, with which molecular tests for a panel of many different pathogens (bacterial, viral, and parasitic) can be performed simultaneously on diarrheal stool samples and, in some cases, rectal swabs
