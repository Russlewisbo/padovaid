## Objectives

## The history of fever {background-image="/images/hippocrates.jpg" background-opacity="0.2" data-background-size="contain"}

<br>

::: incremental
-   **10th Century BCE Persian Physician Akhawayni** defined a system for fever curves in Hidāyat al-Muta'allimīn fī al-Tibb (The Student's Handbook of Medicine)
-   **Hippocratic physicians** proposed that body temperature, and physiologic harmony in general, involved a delicate balance among four corporal humors---blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile.
    -   Fever was due to excess of yellow bile (many infections caused jaundice)
-   **Galen:** many types of fever developed from putrification of humors.
-   **Middle ages:** demonic possession
-   **18th century (Harvey's discovery of circulation)**- friction of blood flow through body causing fermentation and putrification in intestines
-   **Claude Bernard** in the 19th century- metabolic processes in the body

## Febris- Roman Goddess of Fever

<br>

![](images/Febris.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

<br>

The legend of Febris was said to center around the haunting marshes of Camagna in Southern Italy where like clockwork every year, the people would become deathly ill with a mysterious disease. She was so feared by the Romans that the suffering population had created a cult to Febris. They went so far as to wear protective amulets and build her temples in order to worship her to win her favour.

## Fever in modern medicine

-   Wunderlich's pioneering studies of thermometry-normal 37°C

-   Since the 19th century, humans have become gradually colder-0.05° to 0.5°C per decade

-   Current normal range is 36.3 to 36.5°C

## Sequelae of fever

<br>

-   Phylogenetic conservation of fever over the millennia suggests fever is beneficial
-   Most pathogenic bacteria are mesophiles (35°C ideal for growth)
-   Fever generates hepatic iron-sequestering compounds the bind free iron necessary for microbial replication

:::

## Classic FUO

<br>

-   **Definition:**
    -   Temperature of \> 38.3°C \> 3 weeks

    -   Fever \>2 separate outpatient visits with diagnostic investigations *or*

    -   Fever \>2 visits in hospital of 3 days with diagnostic investigations

        -   *However*, these definitions are largely subjective
-   **Leading causes:**
    -   Cancer (age dependent)

    -   Infections (geography dependent)

    -   Inflammatory conditions (age dependent)

    -   Undiagnosed habitual hyperthermia

## Frequency of the 5 main etiologic categories of FUO

Infectious causes decrease in patients above age 65 years

## Classic FUO- Infectious Etiology

-   Occult abscess
-   Endocarditis
-   Tuberculosis
-   Complicated urinary tract infections

## Classic FUO work-up

::: incremental
-   **Medical history emphasis:**
    -   Travel

    -   Contacts

    -   Animal and insect exposure

    -   Medications

    -   Immunizations

    -   Family history

    -   Cardiac valve disorder
-   **Examination emphasis**
    -   Fundi, oropharynx, temporal artery, abdomen, lymph nodes, spleen, joints, skin, nails, genitalia, rectum or prostate, lower limb deep veins
-   **Investigation emphasis:**
    -   Imaging, biopsies, sedimentation rate, skin tests

## Rare and miscellaneous causes of fever

## Distinctive fever patterns {.smaller}

![](images/feverpatterns.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

A. Maleria; B. Typhoid fever with relative bradycardia; C. Hodgkin's disease (Pel-Ebstein pattern); <br> D. Borreliosis (relapsing fever pattern)

<div>

[@wrightwilliamf__mackowiakphilipa_15]

</div>

## Classic FUO in infants and children

<br>

-   Respiratory tract infections
-   Other infections: UTIs, brucellosis, tuberculosis, bartonellosis
-   Kawasaki disease (age \< 5 years)
-   Inflammatory bowel diseases
-   Still's disease (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis)
    -   However, connective tissue diseases and cancers are generally rare in children
-   Joint involvement is an important sign of a potentially serious disorder- *e.g., connective tissue disease, endocarditis, leukemia*

## Classic FUO in elderly patients

<br>

-   **In developed countries: connective tissue diseases \> infections**
    -   Temporal arteritis

    -   Polymyalgia rheumatic syndromes
-   **Diagnoses are frequently missed because symptoms are subacute and non-specific**
-   **Infections**
    -   intraabdominal abscess

    -   Complicated UTIs

    -   Tuberculosis

    -   Endocarditis

## Returning travellers

<div>

[@wrightwilliamf__mackowiakphilipa_15]

</div>

## Nosocomial (Health-Care Associated) FUO

<br>

-   **Leading causes:**
    -   Drug fever

    -   Post-operative complications (e.g., occult abscess)

    -   Decubitus ulcers

    -   Septic thrombophlebitis

    -   Recurrent pulmonary emboli

    -   Myocardial infarction

    -   Cancer

    -   Blood transfusion

    -   *Clostridium difficile* colitis

## Fever in post-operative patients

<br>

-   Although more than 1/3 of patients may manifest fever in first 5 days surgery, \< 10% of febrile patients have an identified source
-   Physiological response to surgically-induced tissue injury with release of pyrogenic cytokines and interleukins rather than result of infection

## FUO in ICU patients

<br>

-   Early fevers are common, often non-infectious, associated with good prognosis
-   Prolonged fever- poorer prognosis
-   Sinusitis as a complication of mechanical ventilation, supine position, feeding tubes
-   Other causes are similar to nosocomial infections
    -   Abscess

    -   Drug fever

    -   postoperative complications

    -   Septic thrombophlebitis

    -   Recurrent pulmonary emboli

    -   Myocardial infarction

## FUO in stroke patients

<br>

-   Non-infective fevers are commonly seen in patients with intracranial mass effects and occur earlier after stroke than infection
-   UTI are common related to urinary catheterization

## FUO in neutropenic patients

<br>

::: incremental
-   ANC= Total WBC x (% Segs + % Bands)

-   ANC of \< 500 cells/mm^3^ or an ANC that is expected to decrease to \< 500 cells/mm^3^ during the next 48 h.

    -   The term ''profound'' is sometimes used to describe neutropenia in which the ANC is \< 100 cells/mm^3^

-   Fever occurs frequently during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia:

    -   10%--50% of patients with solid tumors

    -   80% of those with hematologic malignancies will develop fever during \>1 chemotherapy cycle associated with neutropenia

-   Most patients will have no infectious etiology documented.

-   Signs of inflammation are notoriously absent other than fever

    -   Duration of fever \>2 weeks;

    -   Lack of evidence of infection (eg physical examination, laboratory examinations, and imaging studies);

    -   Absence of allergic mechanisms (eg, drug allergy, transfusion reaction, and radiation or chemotherapeutic drug reaction);

    -   Lack of response of fever to an empiric, adequate antibiotic therapy for at least 7 days;

    -   Prompt complete lysis by the naproxen test with sustained normal temperature while receiving naproxen.

## HIV-related FUO

-   Primary phase of infection characterized by mononucleosis-like illness where fever is common, may be undiagnosed if it precedes seroconversion
-   In later phases of untreated HIV, episodes of fever become common and often signify a superimposed illness- e.g., opportunistic infections that manifest in atypical fashion
-   Once highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is started and HIC viral load is effectively suppressed, the frequency of FUO falls markedly

## Patient history

<br> ::: incremental

-   **Helps guide choice of initial laboratory investigations**
-   **Particular attention should be give to:**
    -   recent travel

    -   exposure to pets and other animals

    -   work environment

    -   recent contact with people with similar symptoms

    -   family history (e.g., familial Mediterranean fever)

## Verification of fever and fever pattern

<br>

-   Seems obvious, but often overlooked
-   In some series, up to 30% where determined not to have fever
-   Fever patterns- arcane terminology:
    -   *remittent, intermittent, hectic, quotidian, sustained, quartan, saddleback fevers*
-   Fever patterns are affected by:
    -   Hydration, ambient temperature

    -   Accuracy of temperature measurements

    -   Use of antipyretics, corticosteroids

    -   Blood transfusions, other medical interventions *etc.*

## Continuous sustained fever

<br>

-   Continuous (sustained) fever with slight remission not exceed 2°C
    -   Lobar and Gram negative pneumonia
    -   Rickettsiosis
    -   Typhoid fever
    -   CNS disorders
    -   Tularemia
    -   Falciparum (malignant tertian) malaria :::

![](images/continuous.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: aside
:::

## Intermittent fever

<br>

-   Intermittent (septic, quotidian, "picket fence") fever with wide fluctuations, usually norma or low in the morning and peaking between 4:00 and 8:00 PM
    -   Localized pyogenic infections and bacterial endocarditis with chills and leukocytosis
    -   Malaria (often with leukopenia) may present with daily (quotidian) daily spike or (tertian) spike every 3rd day, or (quartan) spike every 4th day.
    -   Double quotidian patter (two daily spikes) aen with salmonellosis, miliary tuberculosis, double malarial infections (more than one species), gonococcal and meningococcal endocarditis

::: aside
[@mackowiak_etal97a]
:::

## Saddle-back (biphasic)

<br>

-   Several days of fever, distinct reductio in fever for \~ 1 day, and then several days of higher fever
    -   Dengue and yellow fever
    -   Colorado tick fever
    -   Rift valley Fever
    -   Influenzae and other viral infections

![](images/saddle.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: aside
[@mackowiak_etal97a]
:::

## Intermittent hectic (Charcot's) fever

<br>

-   Sporadic episodes of fever, periods of noram temperature with recurrence
    -   Frequently seen in cholangitis associated with cholelithiasis, jaundice, leukocytosis and toxic signs

::: aside
[@mackowiak_etal97a]
:::

## Pel-Ebstein fever

<br>

-   Weekly or longer periods of fever and equally long afebrile periods, with repetition of the cycle
    -   Hodgkin's disease
    -   Brucellosis due to *Brucella melitensis*
    -   Occasionally tuberculosiso

::: aside
[@mackowiak_etal97a]
:::

## Typus Inversus

<br> - Reversal of diurnal pattern, with highest temperatures in the early morning hours rather than during the late afternoon or evening - Miliary TB - Salmonelloses - Hepatic abscess - Bacterial endocarditis

::: aside
[@mackowiak_etal97a]
:::

## Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction

-   Sharply increased elevation of temperature with shivers and chills occurs within several hours after starting penicillin therapy
    -   Primary or secondary syphilis Leptospirosis or tick-borne relapsing fever
    -   Tetracycline or chloramphenicol therapy for acute brucellosis

::: aside
[@mackowiak_etal97a]
:::

## Physical examination

-   Some signs are subtle and may require repeated exams to be appreciated
-   Vigorous search for lymphadenopathy (consideration for biopsy)

![](images/clinicalsigns.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

<div>

[@wrightwilliamf__mackowiakphilipa_15]

</div>

## Laboratory investigations

<br>

"The cause is more often a *common* *disease* presenting in an *atypical fashion* than a *rare disease* presenting in a *typical fashion*.

<br>

-   Multiple diagnostic algorithms in the literature
-   Must be selectively applies, or will result in excessive tests
    -   False positives

    -   Misguided treatment plans
-   History and physical exam (most important) should guide the choice and sequence of tests

## Examples of potential diagnostic clues

![](images/diagnosticcludes.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

<div>

[@wrightwilliamf__mackowiakphilipa_15]

</div>

## Other diagnostic considerations-bone marrow biopsy

<br>

-   Granulomatous infections (e.g., tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, sarcoidosis)
-   Patients with abnormal complete blood counts (CBC)

## Imaging studies

<br>

-   Generally low diagnostic yield without localizing symptoms
    -   CT of abdomen, chest

    -   Ultrasound of gallbladder and hepatobiliary systems

    -   CT pulmonary angiograms for pulmonary embolus

    -   MRI for CNS, abdomen spleen and lymph nodes Aortic arch and proximal cervical arteries (vasculitis)

    -   Gallium-67 (^67^Ga) scanning

</div>

## Invasive diagnostic procedures

<br> <br>

-   Histopathological examination of tissues obtained by excisional biopsy , needle biopsy or laparotomy can provide definitive diagnosis in some cases

-   Majority of FUO patients will undergo at least one procedure, sometimes several

## Treatment {background-image="/images/thermometer.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

<br>

-   A fundamental principle in classic FUO is that therapy should be withheld, whenever possible, until the cause of fever is determined

    -   Non-specific treatment rarely cures FUO

    -   Delay the clinical diagnosis

-   Clinical reality is that therapeutic trials with corticosteroids, aspirin, antimicrobial agents may be considered

    -   May delay correct diagnosis/treatment

    -   The road to diagnosis of FUO is, by definition, long and frustrating

    -   Clinicians are often pressured to treat symptoms

## Treatment is nearly always indicated

<br>

-   Empirical treatment with corticosteroids in patients with suspected temporal arteritis to prevent vascular complications such as blindness and stroke
-   Febrile neutropenia: high prevalence of serious bacterial infections- patients should receive broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy with anti-pseudomonas coverage after appropriate cultures are obtained
-   Therapeutic trials with narrow spectrum therapy (e.g. anti-mycobacterial agents) may be considered in select cases with history suggestive of TB

## Prognosis

<br>

-   Determined y the cause of fever and nature of underlying disease(s)
-   Elderly patients with malignant neoplasms have the poorest prognosis
-   Diagnostic delay associated with poorer prognosis in:
    -   Intra-abdominal infections

    -   Miliary tuberculosis

    -   Disseminated fungal infections

    -   Recurrent pulmonary emboli
-   Patients with undiagnosed FUO after extensive evaluation still generally have a a favourable outcome, with most patients experiencing resolution of fever within 4 weeks without sequlae.
    -   5-year mortality rates of 3%
