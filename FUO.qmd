## Objectives

## The history of fever {background-image="/images/hippocrates.jpg" background-opacity="0.2" data-background-size="contain"}

<br>

-   10th Century BCE Persian Physician Akhawayni defined a system for fever curves in Hidāyat al-Muta'allimīn fī al-Tibb (The Student's Handbook of Medicine)
-   **Hippocratic physicians** proposed that body temperature, and physiologic harmony in general, involved a delicate balance among four corporal humors---blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Fever was due to excess of yellow bile (many infections caused jaundice)
-   **Galen:** many types of fever developed from putrification of humors.
-   **Middle ages:** demonic possession
-   **18th century (Harvey's discovery of circulation)**- friction of blood flow through body causing fermentation and putrification in intestines
-   **Claude Bernard** in the 19th century- metabolic processes in the body

## Febris- Roman Goddess of Fever

<br>

![](images/Febris.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

<br>

The legend of Febris was said to center around the haunting marshes of Camagna in Southern Italy where like clockwork every year, the people would become deathly ill with a mysterious disease. She was so feared by the Romans that the suffering population had created a cult to Febris. They went so far as to wear protective amulets and build her temples in order to worship her to win her favour.

## Fever in modern medicine

::: nonincremental
-   Wunderlich's pioneering studies of thermometry-normal 37°C

-   Since the 19th century, humans have become gradually colder-0.05 to 0.5°C per decade

-   Current normal range is 36.3 to 36.5°C

## Sequelae of fever

<br>

-   Phylogenetic conservation of fever over the millennia suggests fever is beneficial
-   Most pathogenic bacteria are mesophiles (35°C ideal for growth)
-   Fever generates hepatic iron-sequestering compounds the bind free iron necessary for microbial replication

## Classic FUO

<br>

-   **Definition:**
    -   \> 38.3°C \> 3 weeks

    -   \>2 separate outpatient visits with diagnostic investigations

    -   \>2 visits in hospital of 3 days with diagnostic investigations

    -   *However*, these definitions are largely subjective
-   **Leading causes:**
    -   Cancer

    -   Infections

    -   Inflammatory conditions

    -   Undiagnosed habitual hyperthermia

## Frequency of the 5 main etiologic categories of FUO

Infectious causes decrease in patients above age 65 years

</div>

## Classic FUO- Infectious Etiology

-   Occult abscess
-   Endocarditis
-   Tuberculosis
-   Complicated urinary tract infections

## Classic FUO work-up

-   **Medical history emphasis:**
    -   Travel

    -   Contacts

    -   Animal and insect exposure

    -   Medications

    -   Immunizations

    -   Family history

    -   Cardiac valve disorder
-   **Examination emphasis**
    -   Fundi, oropharynx, temporal artery, abdomen, lymph nodes, spleen, joints, skin, nails, genitalia, rectum or prostate, lower limb deep veins
-   **Investigation emphasis:**
    -   Imaging, biopsies, sedimentation rate, skin tests

## Rare and miscellaneous causes of fever

## Distinctive fever patterns {.smaller}

![](images/feverpatterns.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

A. Maleria; B. Typhoid fever with relative bradycardia; C. Hodgkin's disease (Pel-Ebstein pattern); <br> D. Borreliosis (relapsing fever pattern)

<div>

</div>

## Classic FUO in infants and children

<br>

-   Respiratory tract infections
-   Other infections: UTIs, brucellosis, tuberculosis, bartonellosis
-   Kawasaki disease (age \< 5 years)
-   Inflammatory bowel diseases
-   Still's disease (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis)
    -   However, connective tissue diseases and cancers are generally rare in children
-   Joint involvement is an important sign of a potentially serious disorder- *e.g., connective tissue disease, endocarditis, leukemia*

## Classic FUO in elderly patients

<br>

-   **In developed countries: connective tissue diseases \> infections**
    -   Temporal arteritis

    -   Polymyalgia rheumatic syndromes
-   **Diagnoses are frequently missed because symptoms are subacute and non-specific**
-   **Infections**
    -   intraabdominal abscess

    -   Complicated UTIs

    -   Tuberculosis

    -   Endocarditis

## Nosocomial (Health-Care Associated) FUO

<br>

-   **Leading causes:**
    -   Drug fever

    -   Post-operative complications (e.g., occult abscess)

    -   Decubitus ulcers

    -   Septic thrombophlebitis

    -   Recurrent pulmonary emboli

    -   Myocardial infarction

    -   Cancer

    -   Blood transfusion

    -   *Clostridium difficile* colitis

## Fever in post-operative patients

<br>

-   Although more than 1/3 of patients may manifest fever in first 5 days surgery, \< 10% of febrile patients have an identified source
-   Physiological response to surgically-induced tissue injury with release of pyrogenic cytokines and interleukins rather than result of infection

## FUO in ICU patients

<br>

-   Early fevers are common, often non-infectious, associated with good prognosis
-   Prolonged fever- poorer prognosis
-   Sinusitis as a complication of mechanical ventilation, supine position, feeding tubes
-   Other causes are similar to nosocomial infections
    -   Abscess

    -   Drug fever

    -   postoperative complications

    -   Septic thrombophlebitis

    -   Recurrent pulmonary emboli

    -   Myocardial infarction

## FUO in stroke patients

<br>

-   Non-infective fevers are commonly seen in patients with intracranial mass effects and occur earlier after stroke than infection
-   UTI are common related to urinary catheterization

## FUO in neutropenic patients

<br>

-   ANC= Total WBC x (% Segs + % Bands)

-   ANC of \< 500 cells/mm^3^ or an ANC that is expected to decrease to \< 500 cells/mm^3^ during the next 48 h.

    -   The term ''profound'' is sometimes used to describe neutropenia in which the ANC is \< 100 cells/mm^3^

-   Fever occurs frequently during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia:

    -   10%--50% of patients with solid tumors

    -   80% of those with hematologic malignancies will develop fever during \>1 chemotherapy cycle associated with neutropenia

-   Most patients will have no infectious etiology documented.

-   Signs of inflammation are notoriously absent other than fever

## Clinical manifestations of infection related to absolute neutrophil count (ANC)

| **Purulent sputum** | Pneumonia | 8                             | 84                            |
| **Pyuria**          | UTI       | 11                            | 97                            |

## HIV-related FUO

-   Primary phase of infection characterized by mononucleosis-like illness where fever is common, may be undiagnosed if it precedes seroconversion
-   In later phases of untreated HIV, episodes of fever become common and often signify a superimposed illness- e.g., opportunistic infections that manifest in atypical fashion
-   Once highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is started and HIC viral load is effectively suppressed, the frequency of FUO falls markedly
