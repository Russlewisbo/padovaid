## Infectious Diarrheal Diseases {background-image="/images3/diarrhea.png"}

<br>

<br>

Russell Lewis <br> Associate Professor, Infectious Diseases <br> Department of Molecular Medicine <br> <br>MEP 2491 Infectious Diseases <br> 27 March 2023 <br> <br> ![](800-unipd.svg){fig-align="left" width="300"}

## Objectives

<br>

-   Identify the most common causes of infectious diarrhea in adult patients
-   Describe how the patient history and clinical presentation of diarrhea may favour viral versus bacterial causes that benefit from antibiotic therapy
-   Compare clinical spectrum of disease in resource-rich vs. resource-poor countries

## Background {background-image="/images3/diarrhea2.png"}

<br>

-   Diarrheal disease is one of the top ten leading causes of death worldwide
-   Diarrheal disease is a particular concern for children younger than five years old in resource-limited settings
-   Among adults in resource-rich settings, diarrhea is often a "nuisance disease" in the healthy individual
-   Most cases of acute diarrhea in adults are of infectious etiology, and most cases resolve with symptomatic treatment alone
-   When clinicians care for adults with diarrhea, two important decision points are:
    -   When to perform stool testing
    -   Whether to initiate empiric antimicrobial therapy

## Definitions {background-image="/images3/diarrhea3.png" background-opacity="0.3"}

<br>

<br>

-   Diarrhea is defined as the passage of loose or watery stools, typically at least three times in a 24-hour period
-   Reflects increased water content of the stool, whether due to impaired water absorption and/or active water secretion by the bowel
    -   Acute -- 14 days or fewer in duration
    -   Persistent diarrhea -- more than 14 but fewer than 30 days in duration
    -   Chronic -- more than 30 days in duration
-   Invasive diarrhea, *dysentery*- diarrhea with visible blood or mucous
    -   Dysentery is commonly associated with fever and abdominal pain

## Etiology {background-image="/images3/ecoli.png" background-opacity="0.2"}

<br> <br>

-   Most cases of acute diarrhea are due to infections and are self-limited.
-   Most cases of acute infectious diarrhea are likely viral, as indicated by the observation that stool cultures are positive in only 1.5 to 5.6 percent of cases
-   The major causes of acute infectious diarrhea include:
    -   **Viruses** (norovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, astrovirus, and others)
    -   **Bacteria** (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Clostridioides difficile, and others)
    -   **Protozoa** (Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Cyclospora, Entamoeba, and others
