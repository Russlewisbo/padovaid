## Infections in the Immunocompromised Host {background-image="/images/bacteria.png"}

<br>

<br>

Russell Lewis <br> Associate Professor, Infectious Diseases <br> Department of Molecular Medicine <br> <br>MEP 2491 Infectious Diseases <br> 13 March 2023 <br> <br> ![](800-unipd.svg){fig-align="left" width="300"}

## Objectives

-   Review common immunosuppression risk factors for infection in patients undergoing treatment for cancer/hematological malignancies
-   Anticipate most likely infections based on the the types of immunosuppression
-   Define appropriate prophylaxis and treatment strategies for immunocompromised hosts

## Healthy host

<br>

-   Protection against most pathogens through complex and redundant network of:
    -   Protective surfaces

    -   Cells (e.g., granulocytes, macrophages, NK cells)

    -   Soluble factors (antibody, complement)

    -   Resident microbiota (competition for binding sites and available nutrients as well as shaping the immune system)

## Immunosuppressed host

## Deficiencies in host defences

<br>

-   Although certain organisms can infect patients with specific immune defects, it is not always predictable
-   Basic patterns are recognizable, but the types and severity of complications is often unpredictable
    -   Single, isolated deficiencies are the exception rather than the rule

    -   Multiple defence mechanisms are often affected

        -   e.g., chemotherapy → mucosal barrier injury + neutropenia

        -   e.g., stem cell transplantation → chemotherapy → immunosuppressive therapy + delayed reconstitution of adaptive immunity + graft versus host disease (GVHD)
